\begin{theorem}[$h$-cobordism]
	Within some category of manifolds $\mathscr{C}$, if $M$ and $N$ are closed, simply-connected manifolds of dimensions $\geq 5$ and $W : M \hbord N$ is a simply-connected $h$-cobordism, then $W$ is $\mathscr{C}$-isomorphic to the cylinder $M\times [0,1]$. Furthermore, the isomorphism can be chosen to be the identity on $M\times \{0\}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  The simple-connectedness assumption of the $h$-cobordism theorem is required, since the spaces $L(7,1)\times S^4$ and $L(7,2)\times S^4$ are $h$-cobordant but not diffeomorphic.
\end{example}

\begin{corollary}\label{thm:h-cobordism-diffeomorphism}
	In the smooth oriented manifold category, two simply-connected closed manifolds of dimensions $\geq 5$ are $h$-cobordant if and only if they are diffeomorphic (by an orientation preserving diffeomorphism).
\end{corollary}
