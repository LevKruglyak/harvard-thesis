\chapter*{Conventions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Throughout this thesis, we will assume the reader has studied differential and algebraic topology at the level of an introductory graduate class, as well as an undergraduate level understanding of abstract and linear algebra, category theory, etc. Generally, we will remind the reader of relevant results as needed.
  Some sections will further assume knowledge of differential geometry and homotopy theory, but this will also be specified. Finally, there will sprinkles of more advanced topics in some short sections or remarks, but these will be tangential and may be skipped without consequence by a reader lacking sufficient background.
\end{itemize}
