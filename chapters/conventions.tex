\begin{itemize}
  \item Throughout this thesis, we will assume the reader has studied differential and algebraic topology at the level of an introductory graduate class. We will remind the reader of relevant results as needed. Some sections further assume knowledge of differential geometry and homotopy theory, but this will be specified.
  \item Unless otherwise specified, all manifolds are assumed to be smooth, compact, connected, and possibly with boundary. A manifold is said to be \defn{closed}[closed manifold] if it is closed (and compact).
  \item A topological space $X$ is said to be \defn{$n$-connected} if $\pi_i(X)=0$ for all $i\leq n$. Under this convention, path connected spaces are $0$-connected and simply connected spaces are $1$-connected.
\end{itemize}
