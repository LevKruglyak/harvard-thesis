\section{Brieskorn Varieties}

Let's begin a more rigorous discussion on the connection between knots and complex varieties. 
Let $\C^m$ be the complex affine space equipped with the canonical Hermitian inner product. Throughout, let's suppose that $f : \C^m \to \C$ is a compelx analytic function.


\begin{definition}
  The \defn{gradient} of a complex analytic function $f : \C^m \to \C$ is the $m$-tuple:
  \[
    \nabla f = \begin{pmatrix}\overline{\partial f / \partial z_1}, &\cdots& \overline{\partial f / \partial z_m}\end{pmatrix}.
  \]
\end{definition}
