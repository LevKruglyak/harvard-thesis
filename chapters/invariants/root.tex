In this chapter, we explore a rich theory of invariants for homotopy spheres of dimension $4k-1$ which arise from subtle numerical relations between some topological invariants and characteristic classes. Combined with constructions from the following chapter, this allows us to compute lower bounds on the size of $\bP^{4k}$. We begin with an introduction to characteristic classes and the Hirzebruch signature theorem in \cref{sec:characteristic-classes}, and construct invariants and compute lower bounds in \cref{sec:invariants-for-homotopy-4k-1-spheres}.
