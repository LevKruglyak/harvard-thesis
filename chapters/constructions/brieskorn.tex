\section{Brieskorn Manifolds}\label{sec:brieskorn}

There is an wonderful geometric link between exotic spheres and higher-dimensional knots. While less direct that the plumbing construction, all homotopy spheres in $\bP^{4k}$ and $\bP^{4k+2}$ can be constructed via knots in this way. The standard source on the construction is yet another classic of Milnor, \cite{milnor1968hypersurfaces}. For a more geometric, knot theoretic exposition, see Chapter 19 of \cite{kauffman1987knots}, and for general high-dimensional knot theory see \cite{ranicki1998knot}.

\begin{definition}
  An \defn{$n$-dimensional link} is a codimension $2$ submanifold of $S^{n+2}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark*}
	Classical knots are connected $1$-dimensional links, i.e. embeddings $S^1\subset S^3$. 
\end{remark*}

A particularly algebraic-geometric to view knots is as spherical levels sets of an isolated complex singularity. This approach generalizes easily to higher dimensions. Let us suppose that $F\in \C[z_0,z_1\ldots, z_n]$ is a non-constant polynomial in $(n+1)$-complex variables.
\begin{definition}
	The \defn{variety} of $F$ is the complex hypersurface given by the zero locus
	\[
		\V(F) = F^{-1}(0)=\left\{ z \in \C^{n+1} \mid F(z)=0\right\} \subset \C^{n+1}.
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A point $w\in \V(F)$ is a \defn{singularity}[complex singularity] if $\nabla F(w)$ vanishes. A singularity is \defn{isolated}[isolated singularity] if there is a neighborhood surrounding $w$ which contains no other singularities.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \import{diagrams}{knot-cone.pdf_tex}
  \caption{A link of an isolated singularity.}\label{fig:cone-over-knot}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
	Let $w\in \V(F)$ be an isolated singularity. The \defn{link} of $F$ at $w$ is the set 
	\[
		\L(F, w) = \V(F) \cap S^{2n+1}_\varepsilon(w) = \left\{ z\in \C^{n+1}  \mid F(z)=0\textrm{ and } |z-w|<\varepsilon\right\}
	\]
	where $\varepsilon > 0$ is some sufficiently small real number so that $\L(F,w)$ is the smooth $(2n-1)$-manifold intersecting the sphere $S^{2n+1}_\varepsilon(w)$ transversally. When the isolated singularity is clear, we write $\L(F)$.
\end{definition}

The simplest examples of isolated singularities come from the Brieskorn polynomials.

\begin{definition}
	Let $(a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ be an $(n+1)$-tuple of integers greater than or equal to $2$. The \defn{Brieskorn polynomial} of the tuple $(a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ is given by
	\[
		F(z_0,z_1,\ldots, z_n) = z_0^{a_0} + z_1^{a_1} +\cdots + z_n^{a_n}.
	\]
	Correspondingly, we refer to $\V(F)$ as the \defn{Brieskorn variety} of the tuple and to the link $\L(F,0)$ at the origin as the \defn{Brieskorn manifold}. We denote the Brieskorn manifolds by
	\[
		\Sigma(a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_n) =\L(z_0^{a_0}+z_1^{a_1}+\cdots+z_n^{a_n}, 0).
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	If $p,q\geq 2$ are integers, then $\Sigma(p,q)\subset S^3$ is the torus link of type $(p,q)$. If $\gcd(p,q)=1$ then there is one connected component and so $\Sigma(p,q)$ is a torus knot.

	\begin{figure}[ht]
		\centering
  	\import{diagrams}{torus-knot.pdf_tex}
  	\caption{Examples of torus knots.}\label{fig:torus-knots}
	\end{figure}
\end{example}

Advancing to $3$ dimensions, we note that many familiar spaces can be realized as Brieskorn manifolds. See Chapter 19 of \cite{kauffman1987knots} for the geometric constructions of these diffeomorphisms.
\begin{proposition}
	$\Sigma(2,2,2)\cong \RP^3$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
	$\Sigma(2,3,5)\cong \mathscr{D}$, where $\mathscr{D}$ is the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space.
\end{proposition}

Note that neither of the spaces $\Sigma(2,2,2)$ or $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ are homotopy spheres. However, $\Sigma(p,q)$ with $\gcd(p,q)=1$ is diffeomorphic to a circle. The Brieskorn manifolds will thus be the class of manifolds for our construction of homotopy spheres.

We now make a few remarks on geometric data which comes with a Brieskorn manifold. One of the most important pieces of data is the Milnor fibration associated to an isolated singularity:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:fibration}
	If $F$ is a complex polynomial in $(n+1)$-variables with an isolated singularity at the origin, then there is a smooth fiber bundle map
	\[
		\lkxfunc{\phi}{S^{2n+1}_\varepsilon \setminus \L(F)}{S^1}{z}{\arg F(z).}
	\]
\end{theorem}

This theorem is laid out in depth in Chapter 4 of \cite{milnor1968hypersurfaces}. For a given angle $e^{i\theta}\in S^1$, we denote the fiber of the bundle $\phi$ by $F_\theta = \phi^{-1}(e^{i\theta})$. The main application for us is that the boundary of each fiber $F_\theta$ is $\mathcal{L}(F)$. Furthermore, by Sections 5-6 of \cite{milnor1968hypersurfaces}, we have:

\begin{proposition}
	Each fiber $F_\theta$ is a smooth, highly-connected, parallelizable $2n$-manifold.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark*}
	A link $\mathcal{L}$ which arises from a fibration $S^\ell \setminus \mathcal{L} \to S^1$ with each fiber bounding $\mathcal{L}$ is known as a \defn{fibered link}.
	For general information on fibered links, see \cite{kauffmanneumann1977}.
\end{remark*}

\begin{proposition}
	Assuming $n\neq 2$, $\L$ is a homotopy $(2n-1)$-sphere if and only if $F_\theta$ has a unimodular intersection form.
\end{proposition}
This forms a bridge between knot theory and exotic spheres, allowing classical knot invariants like the Alexander polynomial, signature, or Siefert link matrix to compute exotic sphere invariants.
While computational details are unfortunately outside the scope of this already quite lengthy thesis, the interested reader should look at Chapter 14 of \cite{baadhio1996quantum} or the wonderful essay on exotic spheres \cite{nicholson} which includes Alexander polynomial computations.  We close with a theorem of Brieskorn which solidifies the connection (see \cite{brieskorn1966}):

\begin{theorem}[Brieskorn]
	For $m\geq 4$, every homotopy sphere in $\bP^{2m}$ is the link of some isolated singularity.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
	$\Sigma(3,6k-1, 2,2,2)$ for $k\in \{1,\ldots,28\}$ generate all of $\bP^{8}$.
\end{example}

There are also beautiful geometric constructions expressing Brieskorn as towers of branched covers of knots based on the following proposition:

\begin{proposition}
	$\mathcal{L}(F+z_{n+1}^k)$ is a $k$-fold cover of $S^{2n+1}$, branched along $\mathcal{L}(F)$.
\end{proposition}
