\section{Brieskorn Manifolds}\label{sec:brieskorn}

There is an wonderful geometric link between exotic spheres and higher-dimensional knots. While less direct that the plumbing construction, all homotopy spheres in $\bP^{4k}$ and $\bP^{4k+2}$ can be constructed via knots in this way. The standard source on the construction is yet another classic of Milnor, \cite{milnor1968hypersurfaces}. For a more geometric, knot theoretic exposition, see Chapter 19 of \cite{kauffman1987knots}, and for general high-dimensional knot theory see \cite{ranicki1998knot}.

\begin{definition}
  An \defn{$n$-dimensional link} is a codimension $2$ submanifold of $S^{n+2}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark*}
	Classical knots are connected $1$-dimensional links, i.e. embeddings $S^1\subset S^3$. 
\end{remark*}

A particularly algebraic-geometric to view knots is as spherical levels sets of an isolated complex singularity. This approach generalizes easily to higher dimensions. Let us suppose that $F\in \C[z_0,z_1\ldots, z_n]$ is a non-constant polynomial in $(n+1)$-complex variables.
\begin{definition}
	The \defn{variety} of $F$ is the complex hypersurface given by the zero locus
	\[
		\V(F) = F^{-1}(0)=\left\{ z \in \C^{n+1} \mid F(z)=0\right\} \subset \C^{n+1}.
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A point $w\in \V(F)$ is a \defn{singularity}[complex singularity] if $\nabla F(w)$ vanishes. A singularity is \defn{isolated}[isolated singularity] if there is a neighborhood surrounding $w$ which contains no other singularities.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \import{diagrams}{knot-cone.pdf_tex}
  \caption{A link of an isolated singularity.}\label{fig:cone-over-knot}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
	Let $w\in \V(F)$ be an isolated singularity. The \defn{link} of $F$ at $w$ is the set 
	\[
		\L(F, w) = \V(F) \cap S^{2n+1}_\varepsilon(w) = \left\{ z\in \C^{n+1}  \mid F(z)=0\textrm{ and } |z-w|<\varepsilon\right\}
	\]
	where $\varepsilon > 0$ is some sufficiently small real number so that $\L(F,w)$ is the smooth $(2n-1)$-manifold intersecting the sphere $S^{2n+1}_\varepsilon(w)$ transversally. When the isolated singularity is clear, we write $\L(F)$.
\end{definition}

The simplest examples of isolated singularities come from the Brieskorn polynomials.

\begin{definition}
	Let $(a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ be an $(n+1)$-tuple of integers greater than or equal to $2$. The \defn{Brieskorn polynomial} of the tuple $(a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ is given by
	\[
		F(z_0,z_1,\ldots, z_n) = z_0^{a_0} + z_1^{a_1} +\cdots + z_n^{a_n}.
	\]
	Correspondingly, we refer to $\V(F)$ as the \defn{Brieskorn variety} of the tuple and to the link $\L(F,0)$ at the origin as the \defn{Brieskorn manifold}. We denote the Brieskorn manifolds by
	\[
		\Sigma(a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_n) =\L(z_0^{a_0}+z_1^{a_1}+\cdots+z_n^{a_n}, 0).
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	If $p,q\geq 2$ are integers, then $\Sigma(p,q)\subset S^3$ is the torus link of type $(p,q)$. If $\gcd(p,q)=1$ then there is one connected component and so $\Sigma(p,q)$ is a torus knot.

	\begin{figure}[ht]
		\centering
  	\import{diagrams}{torus-knot.pdf_tex}
  	\caption{Examples of torus knots.}\label{fig:torus-knots}
	\end{figure}
\end{example}

Advancing to $3$ dimensions, we note that many familiar spaces can be realized as Brieskorn manifolds. See Chapter 19 of \cite{kauffman1987knots} for the geometric constructions of these diffeomorphisms.
\begin{proposition}
	$\Sigma(2,2,2)\cong \RP^3$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
	$\Sigma(2,3,5)\cong \mathscr{D}$, where $\mathscr{D}$ is the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space.
\end{proposition}

Note that neither of the spaces $\Sigma(2,2,2)$ or $\Sigma(2,3,5)$ are homotopy spheres. However, $\Sigma(p,q)$ with $\gcd(p,q)=1$ is diffeomorphic to a circle. The Brieskorn manifolds will thus be the class of manifolds for our construction of homotopy spheres.

\subsection{The Geometric Topology of Links}

We now make a few remarks on geometric data which comes with a Brieskorn manifold. One of the most important pieces of data is the Milnor fibration associated to an isolated singularity:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:fibration}
	If $F$ is a complex polynomial in $(n+1)$-variables with an isolated singularity at the origin, then there is a smooth fiber bundle map
	\[
		\lkxfunc{\phi}{S^{2n+1}_\varepsilon \setminus \L(F)}{S^1}{z}{\arg F(z).}
	\]
\end{theorem}

This theorem is laid out in depth in Chapter 4 of \cite{milnor1968hypersurfaces}. For a given angle $e^{i\theta}\in S^1$, we denote the fiber of the bundle $\phi$ by $F_\theta = \phi^{-1}(e^{i\theta})$. The main application for us is that the boundary of each fiber $F_\theta$ is $\mathcal{L}(F)$. Furthermore:

\begin{proposition}
	Each fiber $F_\theta$ is a smooth, highly-connected, parallelizable $2n$-manifold.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	See Sections 5 and 6 of \cite{milnor1968hypersurfaces}.
\end{proof}

These are the bounding manifolds for $\mathcal{L}(F)$ which allow us to compute invariants for homotopy spheres. At this point, a visual example is in order.

\begin{remark*}
	A link $\mathcal{L}$ which arises from a fibration $S^\ell \setminus \mathcal{L} \to S^1$ with each fiber bounding $\mathcal{L}$ is known as a \defn{fibered link}.
	For some general information on fibered links, see \cite{kauffmanneumann1977}.
\end{remark*}



\begin{proposition}
	$\mathcal{L}(F+z_{n+1}^k)$ is a $k$-fold cover of $S^{2n+1}$, branched along $\mathcal{L}(F)$.
\end{proposition}

	\import{diagrams}{branched-cover.pdf_tex}
	\caption{A slice of a $2$-dimensional $3$-fold cover branched along a $1$-submanifold.}
\end{figure}

Let's fix a polynomial $F$ in $(n+1)$ complex variables

\begin{proposition}
	If $n\neq 2$, then $\L$ is homeomorphic to the sphere $S^{2n-1}$ if and only if $\L$ has the homology of a sphere. In fact, $\L$ is a topological sphere if and only if the reduced homology $\widetilde{H}_{n-1}(\L)$ is trivial.
\end{proposition}

Let's now choose an orientation for $F_\theta$.

\begin{proposition}
	The manifold $\L$ is a homology sphere if and only if the intersection form
	\[
		\lkxfunc{Q_{F_\theta}}{\H_n(F_\theta)\times \H_n(F_\theta)}{\Z}
	\]
	has determinant $\pm 1$, i.e. if $Q_{F_\theta}$ is unimodular.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Hirzebruch-Mayer] 
	Brieskorn manifolds are parallelizable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Brieskorn]
	Every homotopy sphere in $\bP^{2m}$ with $m\geq 4$ is the link of some isolated singularity.
\end{theorem}
