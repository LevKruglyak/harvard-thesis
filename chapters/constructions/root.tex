The focus on this chapter will be on three important constructions of exotic spheres -- as total spaces of sphere bundles, as the boundary of a ``plumbing'' of disk bundles along a tree, and as the ``link'' of an isolated singularity of a holomorphic functions. In later sections, it will be possible to directly compute invariants of these constructed manifolds to understand which elements of $\Theta^n$ these manifolds correspond to. As with many challenging topics in math, an abundance of examples helps alleviate some of the complexity, and we hope this chapter can do this for exotic spheres.
That being said, a time-pressed reader need only read \cref{sec:plumbing}, since this is a simple direct construction which will suffice for a classification of exotic spheres in \cref{chap:classification}.

The basic ingredients for a good exotic sphere construction includes the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item A general class of non-trivial smooth manifolds which have highly-connected boundary.
	\item A simple criterion for when this boundary is homotopy equivalent to a sphere.
	\item Some geometric structure on the bounding manifold which simplifies the computation of some topological invariants.
\end{enumerate}
