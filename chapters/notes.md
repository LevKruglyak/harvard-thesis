# Epigraphs

The spinning wheel turns, round and round in a circle. Each fate tied to the next. A thread, red like blood, that stitches together all of our acts. One cannot unravel the knots. They can only be severed. He severed ours, with the sharpest blade. And yet something remains behind that cannot be cut. An invisible bond.

- Martha Nielson, Dark
