\begin{theorem}\label{thm:signature_divisible_by_8}
  Let $M$ be a highly-connected framed $4k$-manifold whose boundary is either empty or a homotopy sphere. Then the signature $\sigma(M)$ is divisible by $8$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:signature_8_existence_theorem}
  For any $t\in \Z$, there is a framed $4k$-manifold $M$ bounding a homotopy sphere and with signature $\sigma(M)=8t$.
