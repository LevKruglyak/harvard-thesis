\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Stephen McKean, without whom this thesis would not be possible. I first met Stephen in his topics class on topological modular forms. Aside from fascinating mathematics, I learned two important things: the power of beautiful mathematical storytelling, and the joys of homotopy theory applied to geometry. 
When I reached out to Stephen to ask about a senior thesis project, he suggested the topic of exotic spheres -- one of the great stories of differential topology and homotopy theory. His guidance, encouragement, and frequent course-corrections have been invaluable throughout my writing process.

I would also like to express my deep gratitude to Professor Dan Freed, one of the constants in my mathematical journey at Harvard.
Aside from imbuing me with a deep appreciation for geometric perspectives, Professor Freed continually inspires me with his unique skills of exposition. With a steady stream of seemingly elementary observations, Professor Freed is able to make even the most non-trivial theorem feel canonical, as if you could have discovered it yourself. However, discovering math is harder than it seems.
One semester, Professor Freed led a reading group with myself and my friend AJ LaMotta which involved no reading -- instead, we were tasked with independently discovering some fundamental results in differential geometry. This approach was challenging and extraordinarily educational.



Additionally, I would like to thank the many professors of the Harvard math department who have defined my past four years -- 
Professors Denis Auroux, Barry Mazur, Mike Hopkins, H.T. Yau, Curtis McMullen, Peter Kronheimer, and Cliff Taubes. 

Dr. Andy Senger, who taught me so much algebraic topology that it took several years for the other mathematical disciplines to catch up.

AJ LaMotta, Ignasi Vicente, Jarell Cheong, Leonardo Kaplan, Zach Halberstam, and many others
