\section{The \texorpdfstring{$\bm{h}$}{h}-Cobordism Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[$h$-cobordism]
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  The simple-connectedness assumption of the $h$-cobordism theorem is required, since the spaces $L(7,1)\times S^4$ and $L(7,2)\times S^4$ are $h$-cobordant but not diffeomorphic.
\end{example}
