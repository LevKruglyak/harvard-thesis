\begin{conjecture}[Generalized Poincar\'e Conjecture]\label{conj:generalized_poincare} Let $\mathscr{C}$ be either $\Top, \PL,$ or $\Diff$. Any $n$-manifold $M\in \mathscr{C}$ which is homotopy equivalent to $S^n$ is also $\mathscr{C}$-isomorphic to $S^n$.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\Theta_n$ be the group of oriented diffeomorphism classes of manifolds homeomorphic to the sphere $S^n$ under the operation of connected sum.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A closed, compact, oriented, smooth manifold $M$ is said to be a \defn{homotopy $n$-sphere} if it has the homotopy type of the sphere $S^n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  $\Theta_n$ is isomorphic to the group of $h$-cobordism classes of homotopy $n$-spheres under connected sum.
\end{theorem}

If $\Sigma$ is a $4k$-manifold, one of its fundamental invariants is the intersection form. 
\begin{definition}
	If $X$ is an $4k$-manifold, the \defn{intersection form} is the symmetric bilinear form
	\[
		\lkxfunc{I_{X}}{\H^{2k}(X)\otimes \H^{2k}(X)}
		{\R}{\alpha\otimes \beta}{\int_X \alpha\smile \beta.}
	\]
\end{definition}
By Sylvester's Law of Inertia, a symmetric bilinear form over a finite dimensional vector space is 

The signature of a $4k$-manifold is the signature of this intersection form, i.e. the difference between the number of its positive and negative eigenvalues. If we let $L_k(x_1,\ldots, x_k)$ be the genus associated to the formal power series $\sqrt{z}/\tanh(\sqrt{z})$, the Hirzebruch signature theorem states that
\[
	\sigma(\Sigma) = \int_\Sigma L_k(p_1,\ldots, p_k)(\Sigma).
\]
For instance, in the case of $4$ and $8$ manifolds, the signature can be written as
\[
	\sigma(\Sigma^4) = \left(\frac{p_1}{3}\right)[\Sigma]
	\quad\textrm{and}\quad
	\sigma(\Sigma^8) = \left(\frac{7p_2 - p_1^2}{45}\right)[\Sigma].
\]
In the case of $4k$-dimensional homotopy-spheres, the signature is zero since spheres have no middle dimensional cohomology. This is emblematic of a deeper issue.

\begin{theorem}[Hirzebruch Signature Theorem]
	If $X$ is a closed $4k$-manifold, then we have
	\[
		\sigma(X) 
	 = \int_X L_k(p_1,\ldots, p_k)(X).
	\]
	where $L_k(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ is the genus associated to the formal power series $Q(z) = \sqrt{z}/\tanh(\sqrt{z})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
	The first few $L$
	\[
		\begin{aligned}
			\sigma(X^4) &= \frac{p_1}{3}[X]\\
			\sigma(X^8) &= \frac{7p_2-p_1^2}{45}[X]\\
			\sigma(X^{12}) &= \frac{62p_3-13p_1p_2+2p_1^3}{945}[X]\\
			\sigma(X^{16}) &= \frac{381p_4 - 71p_1p_3 - 19p_2^2 + 22p_1^2p_2 - 3p_1^4}{14175}[X]\\
		\end{aligned}
	\]
\end{example}
