\begin{theorem}[$h$-cobordism]\label{thm:h-cobordism}
  Let $n\geq 5$ and $\mathscr{C}$ be either $\Diff$, $\PL$, or $\Top$. If $M$ and $N$ are $\mathscr{C}$-manifolds and $W : M \hbord N$ is an $h$-cobordism between them, then $W$ is $\mathscr{C}$-isomorphic to the cylinder $M\times [0,1]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  A closed oriented $n$-manifold $M$ is called a \defn{homotopy $n$-sphere} if it has the homotopy type of the $n$-sphere $S^n$.
\end{definition}
