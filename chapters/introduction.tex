In the years following John Milnor's unexpected 1956 discovery \cite{milnor1956manifolds} of a non-standard smooth structure on the seven-dimensional sphere, the field of differential topology underwent a period of tremendous growth. Within six years of the initial discovery, Milnor and Michel Kervaire would publish a nearly complete classification of exotic structures on spheres of any dimension in \cite{milnorkervaire1963groups}, with intermediate papers \cite{milnor1958manifolds}, \cite{milnorkervaire1960bernoulli}, \cite{milnor1959differentiablestructures}, \cite{milnor1961procedure} filling in the gaps.
Their quick work on this problem was aided by a decade of rapid advancements in adjacent topics -- the works of Ren\'e Thom \cite{thom1954} and Lev Pontryagin \cite{pontryagin1959homotopy} on cobordism, Hirzebruch's signature theorem \cite{hirzebruch1966methods}, Frank Adams' computations of the image of the $J$-homomorphism \cite{adams1966J}, Bott's periodicity theorem \cite{bott1959stable}, Smale's $h$-cobordism theorem \cite{smale1961generalized} and subsequent proof of the generalized Poincar\'e conjecture for topological manifolds of dimension $\geq 5$, and many other results. 

\begin{question*}
  What is the set of smooth structures on the $n$-dimensional sphere $S^n$?
\end{question*}


\begin{conjecture*}[Poincar\'e Conjecture]
  Any 
\end{conjecture*}

\begin{conjecture*}[Generalized Poincar\'e Conjecture]
  Any closed, compact, connected manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a sphere must also be homeomorphic/diffeomorphic to a sphere. 
\end{conjecture*}

The goals of this thesis are manifold. Central among them is the desire for a comprehensive introduction to the topic of the construction and detection of exotic spheres. While researching for this thesis, many sources I found included exotic spheres either tangentially or emphasized a sole aspect of their construction or classification. In this thesis, we take a leisurely route, stopping and appreciating perspectives or constructions which, while not essential, greatly illuminate the topic. Exotic spheres involve many subtle notions, and so focusing on multiple perspectives deepens the understanding of any individual one. 
%
% As promised in the title of the thesis, I also hope to emphasize the role geometry plays in this topic.
% This includes the way in which lattice geometry shapes the topology of exotic spheres, the connection between the index of elliptic differential operators and exotic sphere invariants, and constructions of exotic spheres as towers of branched coverings of classical knots. 


%
% The final aspect I would like to focus on in this thesis is that of computation.
% One of the striking things about the set of smooth structures on spheres is how random it appears. Why are there exactly 28 smooth structures in on 7-dimensional spheres, exactly 6 smooth structures in 10 dimensions and 992 smooth structures in 11 dimensions? It's difficult to answer these questions in a fully satisfying or ``intuitive'' way, and we'll often defer hard and tedious homotopy theoretic results for brevity.
% That being said, there are plenty of places where computations are doable and illuminating -- for instance we'll show, directly, that there are (at least) 28 smooth structures in 7-dimensions and 992 smooth structures in 11-dimensions. I will also include plenty of Wolfram scripts for cases where the lengths of high-dimensional computations exceed our patience.
