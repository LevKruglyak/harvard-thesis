Prologue
  * personal story -- a bit too long
  * first things of writing are very valuable real estate -- be choosey
  * drop off with every sentence
  * if you want to keep length, tie it to the metaphor of manifolds
  * anticipate questions, answer it immediately
    * for example, graphic
    * why don't we know for 4?
  * don't focus the spotlight on you
    * maybe no waxing philosophical

* write in a gentle way
